# Jarrod's work on Programming Language Foundations in Agda

Here you'll find my take on Programming Language Foundations in Agda. I find
that Agda has been a lot easier to learn than Coq. As a result I prefer
[PLFA](https://plfa.github.io/) over [Software
Foundations](https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/). The length of each
chapter in PLFA is also preferable over SF's chapter length. I'm also only
really concerned with interacting with the lambda calculus in its typed and
untyped forms so this book is perfect.
